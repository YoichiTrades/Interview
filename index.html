            <ul> 
                <li> Badger introduced a new line of aggressively priced work boots in fall of 2013 </li>

                <li> Limited additional resources, management must decide if they should focus their efforts on competing with Badger
                     in the work boots sector, or focus their resources on further strengthening their position with casual boots. </li>
                <li> Duraflex hired a leading consulting firm to conduct research to help management in decision making on January 2014 </li>
                <li> Consultants needed to collect information to better understand Duraflex's competitive position </li>
                <li> Developed a 20 minute quantitative telephone survey conducted among 500 randomly dialed consumers in 6 primary regions of the country </li>
                <li> Also completed niternal cost and pricing analysis for Duraflex's work and casual boot line </li>
                <li> Market Pricing Analysis showed Duraflex competing at the premium end of the market for both its casual and work boot lines </li>
